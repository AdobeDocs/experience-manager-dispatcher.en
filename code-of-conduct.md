# Adobe Code of Conduct

## Adobe's Pledge

To foster an open and welcoming environment, both contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in a project and the community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This experience is regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression. Regardless of level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Adobe's Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using a welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Adobe's Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments. This oversight includes commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Or, ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address. It can also include posting by way of an official social media account. Or, it can include acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify the representation of a project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com. All complaints are reviewed and investigated and can result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
